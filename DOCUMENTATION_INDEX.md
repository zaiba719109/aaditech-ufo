## 📦 ARCHIVE/ (Supporting Documents)

**Location**: `ARCHIVE/`

All detailed analysis, decision matrices, and supporting documents moved here to avoid confusion.

### Archive Contents:

```
ARCHIVE/
├─ AUDIT_REPORT.md                  (1,106 lines) - Deep security audit
├─ AUDIT_SUMMARY.md                 (500 lines) - Audit executive summary
├─ IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md         (Consolidated into MASTER_ROADMAP)
├─ START_HERE.md                     (Replaced by MASTER_ROADMAP)
├─ START_HERE_STRATEGIC_PLAN.md      (Navigation guide - now in README)
├─ STRATEGIC_DECISION_MATRIX.md      (Decision framework - in MASTER_ROADMAP)
├─ PHASE_WISE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (10K words - summarized in MASTER_ROADMAP)
├─ FEATURE_TIMELINE.md               (Gantt chart - info in MASTER_ROADMAP)
└─ EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md              (Feature expansion - in MASTER_ROADMAP)
```

**When to use ARCHIVE**:
- 📖 **Deep dive analysis**: Need to understand security audit details?
- 🔍 **Historical context**: Understanding why decisions were made?
- 📚 **Reference material**: Getting more context on a topic?
- ✅ **Verification**: Cross-checking requirements?

## 🎯 DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY

### Consolidation Rationale

**Before** (15+ documents): 
- ❌ Confusion - which is the source of truth?
- ❌ Contradictions - different docs said different things
- ❌ Maintenance nightmare - update in multiple places
- ❌ Overhead - too much reading

**After** (8 active + 9 archived):
- ✅ Clear hierarchy: MASTER_ROADMAP is truth
- ✅ Single source: Information in one place
- ✅ Working docs: Only active implementation guides at root
- ✅ Organized: Archive for reference
- ✅ Efficient: Know exactly where to look

### Document Update Protocol

```
PRIORITY 1 (Update immediately if scope/timeline changes):
└─ MASTER_ROADMAP.md

PRIORITY 2 (Update weekly for next week's tasks):
└─ WEEK_BY_WEEK_CHECKLIST.md

PRIORITY 3 (Update as features progress):
└─ FEATURE_COVERAGE_MAP.md

PRIORITY 4 (Update as needed):
├─ QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
├─ UPDATED_ARCHITECTURE.md
├─ ADVANCED_WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
└─ README.md

PRIORITY 5 (Historical/Reference - rarely update):
├─ ARCHIVE/* files
└─ README_OLD.md
```
