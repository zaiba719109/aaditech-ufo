## 🎯 DOCUMENTATION HIERARCHY

### Consolidation Rationale

**Before** (15+ documents): 
- ❌ Confusion - which is the source of truth?
- ❌ Contradictions - different docs said different things
- ❌ Maintenance nightmare - update in multiple places
- ❌ Overhead - too much reading

**After** (8 active + 10 archived):
- ✅ Clear hierarchy: MASTER_ROADMAP is truth
- ✅ Single source: Information in one place
- ✅ Working docs: Only active implementation guides at root
- ✅ Organized: Archive for reference
- ✅ Efficient: Know exactly where to look

### Document Update Protocol

```
PRIORITY 1 (Update immediately if scope/timeline changes):
└─ MASTER_ROADMAP.md

PRIORITY 2 (Update weekly for next week's tasks):
└─ WEEK_BY_WEEK_CHECKLIST.md

PRIORITY 3 (Update as features progress):
└─ FEATURE_COVERAGE_MAP.md

PRIORITY 4 (Update as needed):
├─ QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
├─ UPDATED_ARCHITECTURE.md
├─ ADVANCED_WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
└─ README.md

PRIORITY 5 (Historical/Reference - rarely update):
├─ ARCHIVE/* files
└─ README_OLD.md
```
